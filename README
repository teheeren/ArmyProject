The ultimate goal of this project is to take the output of WarFoundry and use it to play a game on an android device.

http://warfoundry.co.uk/

Outline:
>> WarHammer.java
This is the main() class. It initializes some Army's and Units for
testing and starts the Game. Goal is that we have a generic game playing
engine and this module would set up the warhammer rules.

>> Game.java
The game sets up a table with a BattleField to display the units, a
Text frame for messages and  a Control Panel to put control buttons.
Warhammer tells it to play() and it starts up the turns and all it
really does right now is the "Close Combat" phase.

>> BattleField.java
Controls actions on the battle field. only active in 
phase 2. Movement phase 
 MouseListener state:
  Idle - click on new unit => Selected; else ignore
  Selected:
    Idle - 
    Moving - 
    Attacking - doubled distance, next click is unit to attack
    Wheeling -
    
 
 KeyListener:
 (Unit must be selected)
 - "A" Attack mode next click selects 

>> ControlPanel.java
Contains control buttons such as:
 - Next Turn
